## Watching the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) is responsible, under the law known as FISA, for overseeing the surveillance activity of the US executive branch.

It has operated since 1978, but had no public docket of orders or opinions until June of 2013. That month, amidst heightened public attention to national surveillance policies, the EFF and the ACLU each filed motions aimed at unsealing FISC records, and successfully requested that these motions themselves become public.

To publish these, the FISC now operates a minimal public docket:

Since then, several other litigants (Microsoft, Google, and an unnamed "Provider") have filed their own outstanding motions with FISC, and they are also public. It is expected that future public records from the FISC will appear at this page.

This project "watches" the FISC docket, and alerts the public and the administrator through tweets, emails, and texts upon any changes.
